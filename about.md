My name is James Hung and this is my blog. I wanted to begin writing about things that I've found interesting and useful as a Software Developer. I'm currently focused on iOS app development using Objective-C and Swift, so you can expect most posts to cater to those areas, but I'm always trying to broaden my tech knowledge.

You may also catch me talking about my latest vinyl record purchase, my attempts to write music, and cooking!

Thanks for reading!
